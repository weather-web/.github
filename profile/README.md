# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## This organization exists to create an app (or many) that will show relevent weather information, abd for at least a little bit this will only support the United States
The primary source code will be in the web-main repo however I plan to have many smaller chunks broken up into many other repos. 
If you have intresting information to add to the tool feel free to either get it added to web-main repo or contact randompersonfromtheinternet17@gmail.com (my alternative email) and we will get it sorted out
